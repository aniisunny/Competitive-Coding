A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

Example 1:

Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
Example 2:

Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
 
Constraints:

1 <= m, n <= 100
It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10 ^ 9.


Solution:-
class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        
        int[][] dp = new int[n][m];
        Arrays.fill(dp[0], 1);
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) dp[i][0] = 1;
        
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++)
            for(int j = 1; j < m; j++)
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];
        
        return dp[n - 1][m - 1];
    }
}
